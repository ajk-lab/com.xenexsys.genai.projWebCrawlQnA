SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
Goal 10 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is to reduce inequality within and among countries. This goal aims to address income inequality, discrimination, and social, economic, and political exclusion.

Key Objectives

By 2030, progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40% of the population at a rate higher than the national average.
Empower and promote the social, economic, and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, or economic or other status.
Adopt policies, especially fiscal, wage, and social protection policies, to achieve greater equality.
Monitor and ensure the reduction of inequality in various dimensions through effective indicators.
