SDG 13: Climate Action
This page provides information about Sustainable Development Goal 13, which focuses on taking urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It emphasizes the need to mobilize efforts to address climate-related challenges.
Goal Description
SDG 13 calls for actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen resilience to climate-related disasters, and integrate climate change measures into national policies and planning. It recognizes the importance of addressing climate change for sustainable development.
Targets of SDG 13

Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters.
Target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning.

Climate Action Data


Why Are These Charts Useful for Awareness?
These charts are valuable for raising awareness about SDG 13 for the following reasons:
CO2 Emissions Chart:
The CO2 emissions chart visualizes data related to carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to climate change. Monitoring these emissions helps track progress in reducing the environmental impact of human activities.
Renewable Energy Chart:
The renewable energy chart shows the percentage of energy derived from renewable sources. Increasing the use of renewable energy is a key strategy for mitigating climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
Key Objectives

Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters.
Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies, and planning.
Improve education, awareness, and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Promote mechanisms for raising financial resources for climate action from multiple sources.

Why It Matters
Climate action is crucial to combat the growing threats of climate change, including extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruption of ecosystems. Achieving this goal is essential for a sustainable and habitable planet.
